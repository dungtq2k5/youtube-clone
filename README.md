This is my first project to getting familiar with HTML-CSS code. And a big thanks to "SuperSimpleDev" for created an awesome HTML-CSS tutorial for beginner video for people like me!!! Through the tutorial I have learnt so much things like:
- The way people design UI for a website on the internet.
- Custom every buttons like padding, coloring and when you hover or click on them.
- Seperate, divide many objects to group, block, ...
- Display, resize the contents when people sizing the web.
  
And at the end! Everythings that I've learnt were shown through this "youtube-clone" project which I created by myself of course only after watching and following carefully SuperSimpleDev's tutorial.
