This is my first project to get familiar with HTML-CSS code. And a big thanks to "SuperSimpleDev" for creating an awesome "HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro" videos for people like me!!! Through the tutorial, I have learned so many things like:
- The way people design UI for a website on the internet.
- Custom every button like padding, coloring, and when you hover or click on them.
- Separate, divide many objects to group, block, ...
- Display, and resize the contents when people size the web.
  
And at the end! Everything that I've learned was shown through this "youtube-clone" project which I created by myself, of course only after watching and following carefully SuperSimpleDev's tutorial.
